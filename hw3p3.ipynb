    "* The goal is to create 4 synthetic data examples with 2D input data, 2 classes, to use to compare the algorithms. \n",
    "* You should use a combination of the following 3 synthetic functions to make your examples:\n",

You could also make one class is a combination of a moon bending oneway and a moon bending the other if that worked better for your example.\n",
    "* Your examples should be such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  One of the four examples will be two well-separated blob classes. This example show that all the classifiers work pretty well (near-perfect or perfect classification)\n",
    "2.  In the two of the data examples, the linear classifier (logistic regression) should do more poorly (both in training and test evaluation) than the others\n",
    "3.  In the second example the quadratic should do very well (both in training and testing) but the linear classifier should do poorly. The SVM, Decision Tree, and KNN should also do better than the Logistic Regressioon\n",
    "4.  In the third example you should be able to construct an example where the decision tree and KNN both overfit so the training error is small but the testing error is large, and linear regression does better\n",
    "5.  The fourth example should be such that SVM and KNN do better than the others (in testing error)\n",
    "\n",
    "In your evaluations, you should always split the data set into a training and test set using [sklearn.model_selection.train_test_splitÂ ](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html#sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split) and also create a report using [sklearn.metrics.classification_report](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.classification_report.html#sklearn.metrics.classification_report)\n",
